## ðŸ”§ MR-VNet: Media Restoration using Volterra Networks

This repository provides the **training and testing code** implementation **based on** the following paper:

> **MR-VNet: Media Restoration using Volterra Networks**  
> Siddharth Roheda, Amit Unde, Loay Rashid  
> *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024, pp. 6098-6107*  
> [[Paper Link]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Roheda_MR-VNet_Media_Restoration_using_Volterra_Networks_CVPR_2024_paper.html)

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This is **not the official implementation** of the paper.  
All code in this repository is **independently implemented by me**, inspired by the ideas presented in the paper.

ðŸ“‚ This repository includes:
- A training pipeline for paired degraded and ground-truth images  
- Evaluation scripts using PSNR and SSIM metrics  
- Support for loading pretrained weights (optional)
